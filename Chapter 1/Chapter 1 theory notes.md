# **Chapter 1 theory notes**

Perceptron - artificial neuron.

Neurons have cell bodies, dendrites, a single axon and connected through synapses.
Perceptrons have computational units, a numbmer of inputs with weights, and an output

Neuron receives stimuli on the dendrites -> neuron activates -> ouputs stimulus on its axon -> transmitted through synapses to other neurons.
Perceptron receives inputs (*x0,x1,...,xn*) -> perceptron applies some activation function that does computations on the sum of weights *z* -> perceptron outputs *y* -> *y* passed as input to next perceptron

Signum function - if input > 0, *y* = 1, else *y* = -1

Bias input - *x0* always equals 1

## Example of a Two-Input Perceptron
